        The introductory CS series was my initiation to structured programming
        as a means to explore the world of computing. I was immediately drawn to
        concepts of algorithmic thinking and the rigorous underlying
        mathematics. I decided to share my love for computation by working as a
        teaching assistant for the CSE 14x community, a class that serves as a
        stepping-stone into the new world of programming. It was the greatest
        experience through my time in college and is the reason I am so
        passionate about promoting computational literacy & inclusive education.
        My responsabilities include:

            I learned <strong>leadership</strong> skills: Teaching a class of 25
            students brought out a plethora of challenges. It was a big
            responsability that I had to take on, and I was thrilled to be part
            of this bigger community through which I could make a difference and
            impact the class that I loved. Progressing as a TA, I was tasked
            with backreading (checking over other TAs grading and deciding
            grading critera). I spent close to 20 hours a week answering
            questions from other TAs, checking and rechecking every point. I
            then worked with instructors to manage the migration the entire
            codebase into new platforms and developed new tools for homework
            autograders and server side networks.

            This created opportunities to <strong>prioritize</strong> and better
            my <strong>time management</strong>: Working on high impact projects
            with faculty, teaching, backreading & taking my own classes all the
            while brought into perspective what it means for 25+ students to
            rely on me. Breaking up large tasks into manageable bits as well as
            prioritizing high value tasks helped me be a dedicated TA and a
            student

            <strong>Communication</strong> ended up being the biggest takeway
            for me: Each week, I had about 5 hours of meetings (& section) that
            I has to present to. Explaining difficult concepts, problems &
            solutions started off as a big challenge but making good use of the
            resources avaialable to me really helped me break through the
            barrier. Communication has stuck with me as I start interviewing for
            internships and full time jobs in industry, by breaking down large
            problems and thinking through them step by step

            Being part of one of the most tight knight and amazing{' '}
            <strong>community</strong> has given me friends for life. Getting to
            know other TAs and instructors personally has been such a rewarding
            experience. From just knowing TAs through classes and meeting them a
            couple times a week, our community has progressed to hours of
            complaining in the library, catching up over pizza parties, game
            nights & going on adventures!
