        Through highschool I lived in the sprawling metropolis of Bangalore,
        India, which has grown over 40% in the last decade and is now considered
        the silicon valley of India. Originally named the garden city, the area
        was filled with pensioners and retired homes but the IT boom has made it
        the supergiant that it is now. Bangalore has been chasing growth,
        focusing on the end rather than as a means to an end, and this has
        created a plethora of problems like housing, population explosion,
        traffic and water pollution. Moreover just like those of the companies,
        there are no standard solution to these problems and hence organizations
        need to start challenging conventional thought. I got exposed to problem
        solving in an innovative approach during my summer internship at Mu
        Sigma, one of the worldâ€™s largest pure play decision sciences companies.
        Working on solving these problems bit by bit, I built a classification
        model to detect automobile insurance fraud with 85% accuracy that was
        predicted to generate a $2M increase in annual revenue. What I learnt
        beyond solving specific problems is the Art of problem solving under 3
        guiding principles viz.

            <strong> Learning is more critical than knowing</strong>: I had very
            little contact with computing and data science going into Mu Sigma,
            but I got more from this experience than any other internship,
            because it started me on a path to computing.

            <strong>The new IP is interdisciplinary perspective</strong>:
            Getting into this totally new domain, synthesizing data and
            information was paramount. This forced me to look at a
            multidisciplinary form of learning and bear these different insights
            to examine complex problems

            <strong>Questions are more important than answers</strong>: This
            foundational principle shapes the programmer I am today. Coming from
            an engineering background, I was always taught to ask questions and
            work through them to figure out my own answer. Google is at a
            fingertip in this data centric world, but the reward of coming to a
            solution in my own way has always been the biggest gift
