            Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sumant, a 20 year old undergraduate student based out
            of Seattle, Washington. Welcome to my slice of the web ðŸ˜€ <br />{' '}
            <br />
            I am a junior studying electrical and computer engineering at the
            University of Washington. Passionate about promoting inclusive
            education and computational literacy, I work as a head teaching
            assistant at the Paul G Allen School of Computer Science and
            Engineering for the introductory computer science series. Teaching
            has been one of the rewarding part of my college experience yet!
            <br /> <br /> I work on a variety of projects across multiple
            platforms such as: Python, React, Java, ReactNative, JavaScript,
            HTML, CSS and C++. Take a look at some of my projects below to see
            my work ðŸ’»
