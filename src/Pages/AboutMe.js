          Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sumant, a 21 year old undergraduate student based out of
          Seattle, Washington. Welcome to my slice of the web ðŸ˜€ <br /> <br />
          I am a junior studying electrical and computer engineering at the
          University of Washington. Passionate about promoting inclusive
          education and computational literacy, I work as a head teaching
          assistant at the Paul G Allen School of Computer Science and
          Engineering for the introductory computer science series. Teaching has
          been one of the rewarding part of my college experience yet!
          <br /> <br /> I work on a variety of projects across multiple
          platforms such as: Python, React, Java, ReactNative, JavaScript, HTML,
          CSS and C++. Take a look at some of my projects below to see my work
