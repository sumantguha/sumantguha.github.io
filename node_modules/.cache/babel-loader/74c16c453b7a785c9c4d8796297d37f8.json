It was very interesting to develop this full stack implementation of the map service, because it required me to work with multiple (Java) frameworks and more importantly, design efficient algorithms at scale. To determine the shortest path between any two buildings/points within campus, an efficient implementation of A* graph search was integrated. The entire grid of buildings was represented as a large graph and hence searching was fairly inexpensive over this structure. To interface with the front-end, we needed to keep track of the exact point that users' clicked, which was done through KD Trees.
