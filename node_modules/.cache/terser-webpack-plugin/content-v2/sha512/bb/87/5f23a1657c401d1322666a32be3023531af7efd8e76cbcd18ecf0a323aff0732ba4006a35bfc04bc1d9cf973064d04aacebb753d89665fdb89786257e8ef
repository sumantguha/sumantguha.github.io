explore the world of computing. I was immediately drawn to concepts of algorithmic thinking and the rigorous underlying mathematics. I decided to share my love for computation by working as a teaching assistant for the CSE 14x community, a class that serves as a stepping-stone into the new world of programming. It was the greatest experience through my time in college and is the reason I am so passionate about promoting computational literacy & inclusive education.

It uses data about the university campus to plot out the entire university and can give directions between any two points of the campus. It computes distances between the different buildings on campus and acts as a simple front end interface for studets and faculty. It covers more than a standard google maps search within the university because it has a more accurate representation of different buildings. It was very interesting to develop this full stack implementation of the map service, because it required me to work with multiple (Java) frameworks and more importantly, design efficient algorithms at scale. To determine the shortest path between any two buildings/points within campus, an efficient implementation of A* graph search was integrated. The entire grid of buildings was represented as a large graph and hence searching was fairly inexpensive over this structure. To interface with the front-end, we needed to keep track of the exact point that users' clicked, which was done through KD Trees. Overall, multiple algorithms were used within this application to ensure efficient computation and fast response time\"]})});};/* harmony default export */ var Projects_maps = (maps_Maps);\n// CONCATENATED MODULE: ./src/images/oldportfolio.png\n/* harmony default export */ var oldportfolio = (__webpack_require__.p + \"static/media/oldportfolio.9091e62e.png\");\n// CONCATENATED MODULE: ./src/Pages/Projects/portfolio2.js\nvar portfolio2_Portfolio=function Portfolio(props){return/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(box[\"a\" /* Box */],Object(objectSpread2[\"a\" /* default */])(Object(objectSpread2[\"a\" /* default */])({},props),{},{children:/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsxs\"])(modal[\"b\" /* ModalBody */],{children:[/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(esm_button[\"a\" /* Button */],{leftIcon:/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(bs_index_esm[\"a\" /* BsFileEarmarkCode */],{}),colorScheme:\"blue\",size:\"lg\",children:/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(esm_link[\"a\" /* Link */],{as:\"a\",_hover:{textDecor:'none'},href:\"https://github.com/sumantguha/portfolio\",isExternal:true,children:\"View Source Code\"})}),/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(esm_heading[\"a\" /* Heading */],{display:\"inline-block\",mr:2,size:\"sm\",children:\"Design Frameworks:\"}),/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(code[\"a\" /* Code */],{children:\"Figma\",mr:2}),/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(esm_heading[\"a\" /* Heading */],{display:\"inline-block\",mr:2,size:\"sm\",children:\"Development Frameworks:\"}),/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(code[\"a\" /* Code */],{children:\"React.js\",mr:2}),/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/Object(jsx_runtime[\"jsx\"])(\"br\",{}),\"An older version of this website!

It uses data about the university campus to plot out the\n        entire university and can give directions between any two points of the\n        campus. It computes distances between the different buildings on campus\n        and acts as a simple front end interface for studets and faculty. It\n        covers more than a standard google maps search within the university\n        because it has a more accurate representation of different buildings. It\n        was very interesting to develop this full stack implementation of the\n        map service, because it required me to work with multiple (Java)\n        frameworks and more importantly, design efficient algorithms at scale.\n        To determine the shortest path between any two buildings/points within\n        campus, an efficient implementation of A* graph search was integrated.\n        The entire grid of buildings was represented as a large graph and hence\n        searching was fairly inexpensive over this structure. To interface with\n        the front-end, we needed to keep track of the exact point that users'\n        clicked, which was done through KD Trees. Overall, multiple algorithms\n        were used within this application to ensure efficient computation and\n        fast response time\n      </ModalBody>\n    </Box>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Maps;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/oldportfolio.9091e62e.png\";","import React from 'react';\nimport {\n  Box,\n  ModalBody,\n  Button,\n  Heading,\n  Link,\n  Code,\n  Image,\n} from '@chakra-ui/react';\nimport { BsFileEarmarkCode } from 'react-icons/bs';\nimport OldPortfolio from '../../images/oldportfolio.png';\n\nconst Portfolio = props => {\n  return (\n    <Box {...props}>\n      <ModalBody>\n        <Button leftIcon={<BsFileEarmarkCode />} colorScheme=\"blue\" size=\"lg\">\n          <Link\n            as=\"a\"\n            _hover={{ textDecor: 'none' }}\n            href=\"https://github.com/sumantguha/portfolio\"\n            isExternal={true}\n          >\n            View Source Code\n          </Link>\n        </Button>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Heading display=\"inline-block\" mr={2} size=\"sm\">\n          Design Frameworks:\n        </Heading>\n        <Code children=\"Figma\" mr={2} />\n        <br />\n        <Heading display=\"inline-block\" mr={2} size=\"sm\">\n          Development Frameworks:\n        </Heading>\n        <Code children=\"React.js\" mr={2} />\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        An older version of this website!
